## when disabled the upstream Host is used as the Host Header

## Email Domains to allow authentication for (this authorizes any email on this domain)
## for more granular authorization use `authenticated_emails_file`
## To authorize any email addresses use "*"

## Htpasswd File (optional)
## Additionally authenticate against a htpasswd file. Entries must be created with "htpasswd -s" for SHA encryption

## Templates
## optional directory with custom sign_in.html and error.html

## Cookie Settings
## Name     - the cookie name
## Secret   - the seed string for secure cookies; should be 16, 24, or 32 bytes
##            for use with an AES cipher when cookie_refresh or pass_access_token
##            is set
## Domain   - (optional) cookie domain to force cookies to (ie: .yourcompany.com)
## Expire   - (duration) expire timeframe for cookie
## Refresh  - (duration) refresh the cookie when duration has elapsed after cookie was initially set.
##            Should be less than cookie_expire; set to 0 to disable.
##            On refresh, LDAP token is re-validated.
##            (ie: 1h means tokens are refreshed on request 1hr+ after it was set)
## Secure   - secure cookies are only sent by the browser of a HTTPS connection (recommended)
## HttpOnly - httponly cookies are not readable by javascript (recommended)
